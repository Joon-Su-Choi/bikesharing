## Summary

Overall Citibike in NYC is doing well and we can make a couple of observations. The average clientele starts and ends reletively around the same area and that their trips are under an hour on average. Peak hours are around 7:00 A.M. to 8:00 A.M. and then again around 5:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. on weekdays. We can make the observation that people are using our bike sharing program around their 9 to 5 work schedule. Using what we know we can further improve the business. An additional visualization we can utilize could be comparing the amount of bike shares across the year on a month to month basis. A second visualization could be using the birth date of the clientele to see the ages amongst them and how often and for long they are using the bike sharing program.
